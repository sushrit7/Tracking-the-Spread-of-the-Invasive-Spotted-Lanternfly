# Tracking-the-Spread-of-the-Invasive-Spotted-Lanternfly


## Overview

This repository is dedicated to tracking the spread of the invasive Spotted Lanternfly using machine learning models, specifically Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Random Forest, with oversampling techniques. The goal is to predict and visualize the potential areas where the Spotted Lanternfly might spread based on historical data and environmental features.

## Machine Learning Models
The project utilizes Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Random Forest models for predicting the spread of the Spotted Lanternfly. The models have been trained on lydemapR dataset. The training code can be found in lyde.ipynb.

## Visualizations
Explore the visualizations folder to view PDF files containing visualizations of the dataset using Tableu.
